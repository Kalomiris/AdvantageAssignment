A method that sorts an input list of integers in order to produce the largest number as a string. 
The basic idea is that each pair of numbers, in list, must be sorted by the comparison of sum with inversion sum.
This is the simplest way to compare  the "image" of 29_81 with 81_29, if the list is {29,81}.
In addition, the sort is carried out with a double loop which using the compare method. The double loop scan each combination of numbers in the list.
